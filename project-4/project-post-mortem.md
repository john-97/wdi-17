## Project Post Mortem
Post mortems are important to understand about what happened in a project and actively think about what you learned.

Post-mortems are meant to be a blame-less space open to objective conversation about what went well and what could be improved.

Even in the examples below, where tens of millions of dollars could be lost, the best approach is to think through the series of events that led to the outcome.

Large mistakes are almost never the fault of the developer, but of the sytems and processes in place to prevent errors and problems.

### What to Bring
Please answer the following questions. Take at least 30 minutes to prepare.

#### Approach and Process

1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
===========================================================================================

1. I would like to learn more about how to play with data other than TEXT BASED DATA --- (audio, video, images)
2. I would like to get better at Algorithms and specifically in web Apps --- I would like to play with more user interactions, (like in a GRAB APP, which users gets the driver? in chat apps, how to add features like reply, or icons, or delete message for individuals VS everyone when the message is alr saved in AsyncStorage. And to make the algo easy. )
3. I would like for the code to be done on a system like Docker, cause I cant so much as open my Project 3 now, It would help not only in the longevity/accessibility with configurations of the project but also to make it easier for Group work.


1. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
===========================================================================================

I think that my approach the React in general is something that I would like to stick to, I like doing things in the following sequence:
1. Plan the UX, and the flow of the App
2. Init App
3. Create Navigation aka the Components
4. Use Redux with Dummy Data
5. .map dummy data And add subcomponents if necessary
6. create Backend to provide dummy data
7. add CRUD interactions (including redux reducers)
8. MVP DONE (Add other features)

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
===========================================================================================

1. I would do my .map function from redux instead of doing a 2 step process of first saving to state before .mapping.
2. I would want my code to be leaner, I find myself redefining things like my navigation function


1. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
===========================================================================================

1. I loved my focus on my CSS... I found myself loving the creation of my project more, and actually enjoying the journey of creating the project when the end result of the project was so much more obvious, I guess I am just slightly more artsy inclined, but it was gr8 to have had CSS, color schemes, how it looks in general in the forefront of my mind.
2. I also learnt some what to not spend too much time on the project, to do other things that I have been missing out on just because the perfectionist in me just wants to learn more, to know more. Basically to chill even when I so love to do something.

  For each, please include code examples.
  1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
  2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

#### WDI Unit 4 Post Mortem
1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
3. How is the overall level of the course overall? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
TAs and AKIRA was awesome!!!!! A slightly faster pace and more walkthrough lessons OR whiteboard showing how things fit tgt lessons would actually go a long way. Overall nice, and motivating class.
