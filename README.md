# Jonathan Chow's WDI Projects

### Summary
General Assembly's Web Development Immersive set forth 4 projects that acted as the main milestones through the project. A improved version of Project-2 as well as Project-4 are included in this folder, and the rest are included as links below.

These Projects were fun! And I am especially proud of project 2 & 4, and made efforts in improving them further and will continue to do so even after my time at WDI.
